  <!-- Parent Function & Transformation Description -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-16 w3-white w3-margin-top w3-card">
    <h3 class="w3-text-blue">Parent Function</h3>
    <p><strong>f(x) = x³ + x² - 3x</strong></p>

    <h3 class="w3-text-blue">Transformed Function</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        g(x) = −1.3 (x³ + x² − 3x)<sup>−0.3(x−(-2.4))</sup> + 2.1
      </strong>  (−2.8 &lt; x &lt; 0)
    </p>

    <p>
      The parent cubic function was transformed to resemble the middle rise and drop of a roller coaster, 
      where the track sharply inclines and then curves downward with increasing intensity. The negative value 
      of (a = -1.3) reflects the graph across the x-axis and stretches it vertically by a factor of 1.3, 
      making the slope appear steeper and more dramatic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The factor (k = -0.3) applies a horizontal reflection and stretch, spreading the curve wider across the 
      x-axis and slowing the rate of change. The horizontal shift (d = -2.4) moves the graph 2.4 units to 
      the left, positioning the main curvature closer to the start of the domain. Finally, the vertical shift 
      (c = 2.1) raises the entire function upward, aligning the track above the midline to represent the 
      elevated structure of the coaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, these transformations produce a smooth yet dynamic cubic curve that captures the accelerating 
      descent of a roller coaster after reaching its middle peak.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32 w3-white w3-card w3-margin-bottom">
    <h3 class="w3-text-blue">Domain and Range</h3>
    <p>
      The domain of this transformed function is restricted to (−2.8 < x < 0), representing the horizontal 
      segment of the roller coaster being modeled. This range of x-values focuses on the key transition 
      between the climb and the drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical position of the curve is influenced by the vertical shift and reflection. With (c = 2.1) 
      and (a = -1.3), the function’s height varies above and below that midpoint. Considering the cubic shape’s 
      behavior within the given x-limits, the approximate range is (0.5 ≤ y ≤ 3.5).
    </p>
    <p>
      This corresponds to the vertical span of the roller coaster’s midsection, from the lower dip up to its 
      elevated crest, illustrating both the climb’s height and the following descent.

    <h4>Parent Function:</h4>
    <p><strong>f(x) = 1/x²</strong></p>

    <h4>Transformed Function:</h4>
    <p><strong>f(x) = 6600 × 1/-(x-(-24))² + 35  (8 &lt; x &lt; 13.8)</strong></p>

    <p>
      The parent reciprocal squared function was transformed to model the steep, rapidly decreasing section of a roller coaster track, 
      where the slope quickly rises and then falls toward the track’s base. The vertical stretch factor (a = 6600) dramatically increases 
      the height of the curve, emphasizing the sharp ascent and rapid decline of this portion of the coaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The horizontal shift (d = 24) moves the graph 24 units to the right, aligning the peak of the curve with the start of the track section 
      being modeled. The negative sign inside the reciprocal flips the curve across the x-axis, creating a mirrored descent that matches 
      the downward slope of the coaster. Finally, the vertical shift (c = 35) lifts the entire function upward, placing the curve above 
      the baseline to correspond with the elevated track.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, these transformations produce a steep, elevated reciprocal curve that realistically captures the sudden rise and fall 
      experienced at this section of the roller coaster.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32 w3-white w3-card w3-margin-bottom">

    <p>
      The domain of this transformed function is restricted to (8 &lt; x &lt; 13.8), representing the horizontal segment of the track 
      that the function models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical position of the curve is affected by the vertical shift and vertical stretch. With (a = 6600) and (c = 35), the function’s 
      values rise sharply from a lower point near the base and reach a peak at the top of the curve. Considering the behavior of the reciprocal 
      squared function over the given domain, the range is approximately (35 ≤ y ≤ 6600 + 35 = 6635).
    </p>
    <p>
      This range corresponds to the full vertical span of the roller coaster’s steep section, capturing both the peak height and the rapid 
      descent to the track below.

    <p>
      <strong>
        f(x) = 4 × sec(0.5(x - (-6.3))) + 5
      </strong>  (−1.8 &lt; x &lt; 1.7)
    </p>

    <p>
      The parent secant function was transformed to model a section of the roller coaster track with pronounced 
      peaks and troughs, representing the steep ascent and descent of the coaster at this segment. The vertical 
      stretch factor (a = 4) increases the height of the curve, exaggerating the peaks to match the towering 
      structure of the track.
    </p>

    <p>
      The horizontal stretch (b = 0.5) widens the period of the curve, elongating each wave to correspond with 
      the gentle slope across the track. The horizontal shift (h = -6.3) moves the graph leftward, aligning the 
      peaks and troughs with the actual starting points of the modeled track. Finally, the vertical shift (k = 5) 
      raises the entire function, placing the curve above the baseline to reflect the elevated position of the 
      roller coaster segment.
    </p>

    <p>
      These combined transformations create a tall, widened secant curve that realistically represents the high 
      points and drops of this portion of the ride.

      The domain of this transformed function is restricted to (−1.8 &lt; x &lt; 1.7), representing the horizontal 
      segment of the track being modeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vertical position of the curve is affected by the vertical stretch and shift. With (a = 4) and (k = 5), 
      the function’s peaks reach up to approximately (y = 9) and the troughs descend to about (y = 1). This produces 
      a range of roughly (1 ≤ y ≤ 9), capturing the full vertical height of the coaster in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of these transformations produces a secant curve with pronounced peaks and troughs that accurately 
      reflect the motion and elevation changes of the roller coaster track.

      <strong>f(x) = -30 × log<sub>117</sub>(x - (-23)) + 20</strong>  (−21 &lt; x &lt; 34)
    </p>

    <p>
      The parent logarithmic function was transformed to model a long, gradual segment of the roller coaster track, 
      where the ride initially rises and then levels off at the peak. The negative vertical factor (a = -30) reflects 
      the graph across the x-axis and stretches it vertically, creating a sharp decline after the ascent that captures 
      the coaster’s downward motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The base of the logarithm (b = 117) controls the rate of growth, compressing the curve horizontally to match 
      the gradual slope of the ride. The horizontal shift (h = -23) moves the curve to the left, aligning the main 
      ascent and descent with the track’s structure. Finally, the vertical shift (k = 20) raises the entire function, 
      positioning the curve at the correct elevation above the baseline of the roller coaster.
    </p>

    <p>
      These combined transformations result in a logarithmic curve that accurately models the rise and subsequent descent 
      along this section of the track, providing a smooth and realistic representation of the ride’s vertical motion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Domain and Range Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32 w3-white w3-card w3-margin-bottom">

    <p>
      The domain of this transformed function is restricted to (−21 &lt; x &lt; 34), representing the horizontal span 
      of the roller coaster section being modeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range is determined by the vertical reflection, vertical stretch, and vertical shift. With (a = -30) and 
      (k = 20), the function descends from a maximum near (y = 20) to a minimum around (y = -10). Thus, the range 
      can be approximated as (−10 ≤ y ≤ 20), capturing the full vertical movement of the coaster along this segment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, the transformed logarithmic function effectively illustrates the steepness, elevation, and gradual 
      leveling of the roller coaster, accurately representing both the horizontal and vertical structure of the track.
